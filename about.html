            <h3>Environmentally friendly Cleaning by Color Coding method</h3>
            <p>For many cleaning companies, environmentally friendly cleaning is a rhetoric to get the attention of their customers. But we really take it seriously. For us, environmentally friendly cleaning is achieved through the application of color coding. Color coding helps us segregate cleaners and equipment to use these in different work areas. Color coding method is an integral part of our cleaning processes because we believe it is the most hygienic and efficient cleaning method. Through color coding, we ensure that certain cleaning agents and equipment are used in certain parts of houses and commercial premises. The purpose of color coding is to prevent infection and the spread of infections in workplaces and residential environments. According to the British Institute for Cleaning Sciences (BICSc), color codes contribute to the consistent use of equipment,materials and processes in specific areas.
              <br><br>We use the equipment that supports a color coding cleaning scheme. The objects that we color code can contain:
              Mops, Swab yarn, Shaft, Mop stand, Tablecloths, Dust flippers, Brushes, Sponges / Scrubbing blocks, Floor wrecks, Garbage collectors, Spray bottles / Syringes, Buckets, Ladders and Other Cleaning equipment.</p>
            <h3>Color coding method</h3>
            <P>Red-color-coded materials and tools are used for cleaning in areas / environments with a higher risk of infection, such as toilets and urinals.

              <br><br>Yellow color-coded materials and tools are used to clean sinks, mop floors, clean service camps, metal surfaces, laboratory equipment, mirrors, gyms and workshops.
              
              <br><br>Blue color-coded materials and tools are used in smaller risk areas, e.g. Offices, entrances, hallways, living rooms, bedrooms, computers, walls, tiles, windows, etc.
              
              <br><br>Green color-coded materials and tools are used for cleaning in kitchens, food processing areas and restaurants.</P>

            <h3>Clear terms of use and clear and quantifiable instructions</h3>
            <p>We believe that clarity provides the basis for long-term relationships, whether personal or professional. That is why we give our workers and our customers clear work specifications and work schedules.</p>
